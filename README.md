Welcome to the Zoom Lifestyle project by Hmabiola!

This project restructures an existing website @zoomlifestlye to a more visually appealing version using modern framework and libraries. It is now built with React.js and subordinating libraries (Daisy UI, Pace UI and tailwind CSS). It comprises 4 webpages, namely: Homepage, which is the landing page, Frequently asked questions (FAQs page), upload page, which provides users means to upload media files to the platform and lastly, contact page. Each page is structured to consist of a uniform nav-bar comprising application's logo, navigation links and buttons.
